// This class is a proxy used to post tasks to an target thread from any other thread. The proxy may be shut down at
// any point from the target thread after which no more tasks posted to the proxy will run. In other words, all
// tasks posted via a proxy are scoped to the lifecycle of the proxy. Use this when posting tasks to an object that
// might die with tasks in flight.
//
// The proxy must be created and shut down from the target thread, tasks may be posted from any thread.
//
// Implementation note: Unlike ScopedRunnableMethodFactory in Chromium, pending tasks are not cancelled by actually
// destroying the proxy. Instead each pending task holds a reference to the proxy to avoid maintaining an explicit
// list of outstanding tasks.
